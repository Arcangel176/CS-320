When I write code, I focus on making it work first, then I refine it for security. I test it in small parts (unit testing) and check for vulnerabilities using tools like SonarQube. I also make sure to update libraries to avoid known security risks.

To understand what users need, I talk to them directly or create surveys to get feedback. I break down their requests into smaller tasks and prioritize the most important ones. Sometimes, I build a simple prototype first to see if it matches their expectations before finishing the full version.

For software design, I start by planning the main features and choosing a basic structure (like MVC if it's a web app). I keep it flexible so I can make changes later. As I code, I refactor often to keep everything clean and efficient, especially after testing or getting user feedback.
